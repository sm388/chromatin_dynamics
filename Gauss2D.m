% z = Gaussian2D(p,x,y)
% 
% Summary:
%     This function calculates a 2D gaussian function with parameters set in
%     p and x and y coordinates
%     
% Input:
%     p - a vector of the means and sigmas and amplitude
%     x - x coordinate
%     y - y coordinate
%     
% Output:
%     z = 2D gaussian value
