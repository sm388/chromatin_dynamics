% to detect spots of arbitrary shape in the image
%
% locate spots that may or may not be diffraction limited. Finds local peaks 
% and then constructs a
% shell of user determined thickness at radius away from bright pixels. 
% The intensity of the spot is measured as the ratio of the peak intensity 
% to the intensity of pixels within the shell.
%
% INPUT:
% image_stack     - matrix representing 3D image
% optional parameters for detection:
% peakRadius - a pixel will only be considered a local maxima if it is the
%             brightest peak within radius defined by peakRadius 
% edgeDist   - Radius from the peak where the outter edge of the shell will
%             be constructed
% shellThickness 
%           - thickness of the shell constructed at edgeDist to be used in 
%             intensity ratio calculation
% centerDist - Radius from the peak that will be used to calculate peak
%             intensity. Intensity of all pixels within centerDist from the
%             peak will be used in the intensity ratio calculation. Should 
%             typically be set to small values (i.e., 1)
% intensityRatioThreshold 
%           - if the ratio if peak to shell intensity is less
%             than intensityRatioThreshold, the spot will be discarded
% quantileThreshold 
%           - pixels must be greater than quantileThreshold in the
%             spot to be fit, else they will be ignored even if they are
%             within fitRadius. This permits a large fit radius to be
%             selected for irregular spots. Pixels to fit can then be
%             chosen based on intensity by modulating quantileThreshold
% fitRadius  - radius in pixels from the peak used to perform centroid 
%             calculation
%
% OUTPUT:
% spotData3 - spots data, organized as a cell array, with each entry
% having
%            .spotPosition - xyz coordinates of the spot centroid
%            .intensityRatio - intensity Ratio of outer shell pixels to the cneter pixels;
%           .spotIntensity  - spot intenisty calculated as total intenisty of spots above quantileThrehsold within fitRadius ;
% params - structure conataing values of used parameters, date and version info
% potentialXYZ - coordinates of all local peaks intially identified before filtering using intenistyRatio
